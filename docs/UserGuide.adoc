== Features

// Preface here
The features provided in CYNC were mainly designed to speed up the process of businesses reaching out to their customers and to store customers' information efficiently.

=== Navigating the command predictions

CYNC has a command prediction feature, which tries to predict the commands that you will type
before you even finish typing it. This allows the user to save time on typing and focus on
making their customers happy.

While entering a command, if a command prediction is available, it will appear as a list
below the input field, as shown in the image below.

_Figure 3.1 : The Command Prediction Panel_

Use the `up` and `down` arrow keys to navigate up or down the list.

image::command-prediction-2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 3.2 : Pressing the `down` arrow key will navigate to the next command prediction_

Use the `tab` key to select a prediction.
The input field will immediately be updated to contain the text prediction!

=== Viewing help : `help`

If you need help with the usage of the software, type `help` in the command box to open up this guide +
Format: `help`

=== Adding a new customer: `add`

// "add a person" is too stiff- use "to add a contact to your address book"
// special notes (another section) - elaborate what tag is- "if you want to sort users by groups"
Adds a new customer to the CYNC +
Every customer will require a name[n/], email[e/], address[a/]. +
tags[t/] could be added to a customer for grouping.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====


[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

// elaborate what does the n all these stand for?
