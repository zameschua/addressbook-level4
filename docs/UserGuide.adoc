== Welcome to CYNC
CYNC is an open-source software that helps small businesses to track and nurture relationships with customers. +
'CYNC' was derived from the word " Sync ", and aims to keep customers and businesses in sync.

The first 'C' in CYNC stands for the customer. This shows how much we value your customers and understand that it's
a businesses' main priority. Hence, we store the customers' information safely and allow you to
effectively monitor their activities.

CYNC also places a large focuses on efficiency.
It's Command Line Interface (CLI) allows users to add or retrieve customer's data quickly.

== Getting Started

// Preface here
Thank you for selecting CYNC as your preferred customer manager!
Here are some steps to get you started:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
If you are unsure how to check Java version on your computer, do check out this link:https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml[link]. +
To download the latest Java version, click link:https://java.com/en/download/[here].

+
[WARNING]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `CYNC.jar` link:https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W15-B2/main/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for CYNC.
// What is GUI?
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The link:#GUI[GUI] should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
// Where is the command box?

.  Type the command in the link:#UI[command box] and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

wish to familiarise yourself with the layout of CYNC. This will help you to better understand the instructions for each
feature later on.

== UI Segments
We wanted to keep the UI of CYNC easy and simple to navigate. CYNC's UI is split into 5 different components.

[#UI]

== Features

The features in CYNC are designed to assist businesses in storing their customers' information.
We understand that small business owners are often strapped for time, so we have kept the commands short and intuitive.

Feel free to jump to the relevant command that you think will be useful to you. If you have no idea where to start,
we recommend you to read the `add` command instruction as you will definitely need this command to get started.

// tag::commandprediction[]
=== Navigating the command predictions

CYNC has a command prediction feature, which tries to predict the commands that you will type
before you even finish typing it. This allows the user to save time on typing and focus on
making their customers happy.

While entering a command, if a command prediction is available, it will appear as a list
below the input field, as shown in the image below.

image::command-prediction-1.png[width="790"]
_Figure 3.1 : The Command Prediction Panel_

Use the `up` and `down` arrow keys to navigate up or down the list.

image::command-prediction-2.png[width="790"]
_Figure 3.2 : Pressing the `down` arrow key will navigate to the next command prediction_

Use the `tab` key to select a prediction.
The input field will immediately be updated to contain the text prediction!

=== Viewing help : `help`

If you need help with the usage of the software, type `help` in the command box to open up this guide +

=== Adding a new customer: `add`

This is your most important feature of Cync as it allows you to add a customer's information into Cync. +
Every customer will require a name[n/], email[e/], address[a/].

If you wish to group the customers together, you can use our tags[t/] feature.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]...`
====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====


[TIP]
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
